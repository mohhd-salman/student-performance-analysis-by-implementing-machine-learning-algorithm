Dateset source and information : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance

In this student performance dataset i have implemented some supervised machine learning algorithm and campare the accuracy for binary classification and 5-level classification.
1. Binary classification – pass if G3(class)>=10, else fail;
2. 5-Level classification – based on the Erasmus1
grade conversion system.
where G3(class):
'A':16-20
'B':14-15
'C':12-13
'D':10-11
'F':0-9
